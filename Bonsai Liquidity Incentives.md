Based on the information provided in the [[README]], the Bonsai report can focus on several domains of analysis to explore how liquidity can be secured with cryptographic incentives, and how to enhance the velocity of money within the network. Here are some suggested domains of analysis:

### 1. **Cryptographic Incentives for Liquidity Provision**
   - **Staking Mechanisms:** Analyze the role of staking mechanisms in securing liquidity. Staking can incentivize users to lock up their assets in return for rewards, thus providing liquidity to the network.
   - **Liquidity Mining:** Explore liquidity mining programs as a way to distribute tokens to liquidity providers, encouraging users to contribute to liquidity pools.
   - **Yield Farming Strategies:** Investigate various yield farming strategies that can attract liquidity providers by offering them higher returns on their staked assets.

### 2. **Enhancing the Velocity of Money**
   - **Transaction Fee Models:** Examine how different transaction fee models (e.g., gas fees, dynamic fees) can influence the velocity of money within the network.
   - **Layer 2 Solutions:** Consider the impact of Layer 2 scaling solutions on transaction speed and costs, which can directly affect the velocity of money.
   - **Interoperability Protocols:** Study the role of interoperability protocols in facilitating cross-chain transactions, potentially increasing the velocity of money across different blockchain networks.

### 3. **Incentives to Forego Selling**
   - **Lock-up Periods with Benefits:** Analyze the effects of lock-up periods where users are incentivized to hold their assets for a certain period in exchange for benefits (e.g., higher staking rewards, governance rights).
   - **Loyalty Programs:** Explore the implementation of loyalty programs that reward users for holding assets, such as increased voting power in DAOs or access to exclusive features.
   - **Utility Token Models:** Investigate how utility tokens can provide users with ongoing value within the network, reducing their incentive to sell. This could include access to premium features, discounts, or other benefits.

### 4. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Innovations**
   - **Automated Market Makers (AMMs):** Study the role of AMMs in providing liquidity and enabling token swaps without the need for traditional market makers.
   - **Synthetic Assets and Derivatives:** Consider the potential of synthetic assets and derivatives to provide additional liquidity and hedging opportunities within the network.

### 5. **Governance and Community Engagement**
   - **Token-based Governance:** Examine how token-based governance models can incentivize users to participate in the decision-making process, potentially increasing their commitment to the network.
   - **Community Funds and Grants:** Explore the impact of community funds and grants on encouraging development and innovation within the network, fostering a more vibrant ecosystem.

### 6. **Trustless Coordination Mechanisms**
   - **Smart Contract Incentives:** Delve into how smart contracts can be used to create trustless coordination mechanisms, ensuring that incentives are automatically distributed according to predefined rules.
   - **Retroactive Public Goods Funding:** Investigate the potential of retroactive public goods funding as a way to reward contributors to the network's development and growth.

By focusing on these domains, the Bonsai report can provide comprehensive insights into how liquidity can be effectively secured and managed within the network, leveraging cryptographic incentives and innovative approaches to foster a thriving ecosystem.
