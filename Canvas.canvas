Please refer to our contribution guidelines for more information on how to get involved.\n\n## Factory Protocol Integration for Community Driven Incentives\n\nA pivotal aspect of the Bonsai ecosystem is the use of factory protocols to create community-driven incentives. The basic premise is that NFTs purchased with $BONSAI fill incentive pools for collections selected by tokenholders. This allows artists to obtain decentralized subsidies to give out to their collectors, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between creators and supporters within the ecosystem.\n\nThe factory protocol integration serves as a mechanism to incentivize engagement, promote discovery of new talent, and support the growth of the broader NFT community on Polygon. As holders of $BONSAI participate in voting for collections to receive subsidies, they become actively involved in shaping the direction of the ecosystem. This democratizes the allocation of resources and encourages a more inclusive and collaborative environment.\n\nCase studies highlighting successful implementation and use cases of this integration within the Lens Protocol will be presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of factory protocols in fostering growth and engagement within the Bonsai ecosystem. These real-world examples showcase the potential for decentralized subsidies to support creators while fostering a thriving and sustainable ecosystem for all participants.","x":1473,"y":-233,"width":745,"height":1876,"color":"6"},
